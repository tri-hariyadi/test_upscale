### How to Run

#### 1. Make sure nodejs is installed in your machine (minimum Nodejs version is v22.17.0)

#### 2. Install dependency

```shell
yarn install
```

#### 3, Make sure your API BaseURL is correct on `todo-app-client/src/lib/api/api.ts` adjust to your API server url

#### 4. Run the application in dev mode

```shell
yarn dev
```

#### 4. open web app on http://localhost:5173/

If you use `docker` and `docker-compose`, you can run a single package project and its server application with a single
command without the hassle of running the client and server applications individually. Follow the guide here.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)
  uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast
  Refresh
